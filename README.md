# BlogCode
Here I'll upload all the code I publish on the blogposts available on my tumblr blog categorized under each blogpost title. I'll be doing updates and bugfixes too, so make sure you always keep the most recent version on hand. 


#DISCLAIMER
Any projects I post here can and/or will contain plugins not made by me. I take no ownership of any plugins, assets or code unless otherwise stated. The scripts I make will contain a small sticky, notifying you that I, was in fact, the maker, and those scripts will also be present on their own, outside of the example projects.
